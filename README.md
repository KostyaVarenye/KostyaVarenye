### Hi there, my name is Kostya 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on getting a degree and honing my programming skills.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning like a sponge, absorbing everything I can!
- 💬 Ask me about anything.
- 📫 How to reach me: TBD.
- ⚡ Fun fact: Knowing multiple languages leads to higher levels of abstract thought. I speak in 3 languages (excluding programming languages 😄).
